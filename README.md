# Media Countdown Timer by BadFox (OBS Script)

This script is a modification of the [Media Countdown Timer script by Luuk Verhagen](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/media-countdown-timer.1135/).  

## Features  
This script creates a countdown timer from a text source when a video file goes on air.  

### Enhancements over the original script:  
- **Automatic text clearing** – The text source is cleared after the video ends.  
- **Dynamic text color changes** – The timer changes color based on the remaining time.
